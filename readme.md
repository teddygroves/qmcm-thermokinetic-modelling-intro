# How we do thermokinetic modelling of metabolic reaction networks

This repository contains a document explaining how we (the Quantitative
Modelling of Cell Metabolism group) approach our project to fit Bayesian
thermokinetic metabolic models.

The document is written in [pandoc
markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) and is designed to
work with [quarto](https://quarto.org/).

To create an html, pdf and docx version of the document, first install quarto
then run this command:

```sh
quarto render thermokinetic-modelling-intro.qmd
```

To create a live preview, run this command:

```sh
quarto preview thermokinetic-modelling-intro.qmd
```
